## 🔧 What Was Done:

### 1. **OpenAI SDK Installed**
```bash
npm install openai@^4.28.0
```

### 2. **API Route Created**
File: `app/api/ask-doubt/route.ts`
- Accepts POST requests with question
- Calls OpenAI GPT-4 API
- Returns structured JSON response

### 3. **Frontend Updated**
File: `app/page.tsx`
- Real API call instead of demo data
- Error handling with fallback
- Loading states

### 4. **API Key Configured**
Your API key is hardcoded in the route (for prototype)
⚠️ **Note:** In production, use environment variables!

## 🔒 Security Notes:

### Current Setup (Prototype):
- ⚠️ API key hardcoded in route file
- ⚠️ Public in code

### Production Setup (TODO):
1. Move to `.env.local` file
2. Use `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Never commit API keys
4. Use server-side only
5. Add rate limiting
6. Add authentication

---

## 🐛 Error Handling:

### If API Fails:
1. Shows console error
2. Displays demo response
3. Shows alert to user
4. Doesn't break the app

### Common Errors:
- Invalid API key → Check key
- Rate limit → Wait & retry
- Network error → Check internet
- Timeout → Increase timeout

---

## 📈 Next Steps:

### Improvements:
1. ✅ Add caching (same questions)
2. ✅ Stream responses (real-time)
3. ✅ Add retry logic
4. ✅ Better error messages
5. ✅ Usage analytics
6. ✅ Cost tracking
7. ✅ Response quality rating
